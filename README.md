**LIMITATIONS**

* Only reagents that are within your player bags, and the player reagent bag will be continually stacked -- not your bank, reagent bank, or warband bags.
* Blizzard has some weird logic that will cause the crafting to fail to if you do it while your player bank is open and the addon tries to stack. CLOSE THE BANK.
* The reagent type must first be manually selected. CHOOSE THE FIRST OPTION OF THAT TYPE/QUALITY ALWAYS
* If you click the create all button and it instantly fails due to a stacking issue, this addon will build the stack properly, so when you click it again, it will work the 2nd time. The issue is that the addon cannot auto-trigger crafting to start as this is a protected action restricted from addons. So, it will rebuild the stack, but you will need to click the button again. Double to check you are selecting the first stack in the reagent choices.
