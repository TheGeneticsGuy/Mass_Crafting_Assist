# Mass Mill Assist - World of Warcraft Addon

**WHAT IT DOES**

Assists in Mass Milling herbs in World of Warcraft by allowing you to mass mill nonstop all the herbs in your bags.

* Compatible with mass milling of the current expansion, as well as all previous expansion herbs.
* Continually combines all stacks of the originally selected herb until complete
* Helps avoid the stacking error that prevents you from mass milling even though you should be able to.

**LIMITATIONS**

* Only herbs that are within your player bags, and the player reagent bag will be continually stacked, not bank, reagent bank, or warband bags.
* Blizz has some weird logic that will cause the herbs to fail to mass mill if you do it while your player bank is open. CLOSE THE BANK.
* The herb type must first be manually selected. CHOOSE THE FIRST OPTION ALWAYS
    - By choosing other bag item slots than the first
